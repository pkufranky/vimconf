This plugin generates a menu and Ex commands from a template file containing
user defined comment templates to be used for source code documentation with
Doxygen.

 How to add this help file to Vim's help    |add-local-help|

Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, IDL and to
some extent PHP, C#, and D (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html, 
and Doxygen manual).
Doxygen allows a variety of styles for special documentation blocks.  There is
also a great number of Doxygen commands which can be combined freely into
comment blocks.  For that reason it makes no sense to code these possibilities
directly into a plugin. Therefor this plugin let you define a  file with
templates for Doxygen documentation blocks. This file will be read when Vim
starts or by an explicit rebuild command. The template file will then be
analyzed and a menu item will be created on the fly for each template found
(gVim). In parallel an Ex command will be generated for each item. For the
console version Vim only the Ex commands are available.

REMARK. Beside the name this plugin has nothing which is really Doxygen
specific. It can be used as a versatile general purpose tool to conveniently
manage text snippets. Even the menu name and the command leader can be changed
(see|doxygensupport-customization|).

==============================================================================
1.  THE TEMPLATE FILE                           *doxygensupport-template-file*
==============================================================================

The template file (default is $HOME/.vim/plugin/doxygen.templates) can have
three sorts of entries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  Template file comments                 *doxygensupport-template-comments*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lines starting with a '#' are comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2  Template file macros                     *doxygensupport-template-macros*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macros are optional. The syntax is

|$<macroname>$| = <macroexpansion>

A <macroname> starts with a letter followed by optional letters,  digits or
underscores.
A <macroexpansion> is the text on the right of the equal sign, starting with
the first non-whitespace character after the equal sign and ending with the
last non-whitespace in this line. An example

|$AUTHOR$|  = Dr. Fritz Mehner 

An <macroexpansion> may contain other macros to be expanded. The recursion is
limited by the expansion algorithm to a depth of 10.  The order of the macro
definitions does not matter. Macro names are case sensitive.

There are a few predefined macros:

|$DATE$|         The preferred date representation for the current locale
                 without the time.
|$YEAR$|         The year as a decimal number including the century.
|$TIME$|         The preferred time representation for the current locale
                 without the date and the time zone or name or abbreviation.
|$FILE$|         The filename without the path.
|$PATH$|         The pathname without filename.
|$CURSOR$|       The cursor postion after the insertion of the template.

|$sortmenus$|    Sorted menus yes/no (see below)
|$includefile$|  Include a template file (see below).

REMARKS. Case of letters matters. Do not name a macro|$Id: doxygensupport.txt,v 1.8 2007/08/05 09:10:38 mehner Exp $|if you want this to
be expanded by a revision control system.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3  Predefined Control Macros                 *doxygensupport-control-macros*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The menu items can be sorted with the macro

|$sortmenus$| = yes   

Default is 'no'.

This plugin has an include mechanism. The templates can be split in different
files. These can be included, e.g.

|$includefile$| = doxygen.cpp.templates
|$includefile$| = doxygen.java.templates

Each file will be included only once. The file names may not have a path. The
path is assumed to be the same as for the main templates file (see
|doxygensupport-template-file|).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4  Doxygen Templates                      *doxygensupport-doxygen-templates*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A template definition has the following form:

==<templatename>==[<insert mode>==][comment]
1. template line
2. template line
  ...

It starts with a headline with the syntax shown above followed by a Doxygen
comment. The insert mode part (see below) and the comment part are optional.
Whitespaces between the parts are allowed.  The end of a definition is the
start of a new template definition or the end of the file. 

A <templatename> starts with a letter followed by optional letters, digits,
or allowed delimiters. The allowed delimiters are

  ' '     blank
  '-'     minus
  '+'     plus
  '_'     underscore
  ','     comma
  '.'     point

A template can contain empty lines. The number of templates is not limited.
Here an example template enclosed in delimiting comments:

#--------------------------------------------------------------
==brief+detailed==
/**
 *  \brief |$CURSOR$|
 *  
 *  Detailed description starts here.
 */
#--------------------------------------------------------------


Insert mode specification <insert mode>
---------------------------------------

There are 4 insert modes: 'below', 'above', 'append', and 'insert'. The
default is 'below' The insert mode specification is optional. A wrong
specification will be replaced by the default.

BELOW. A comment block will typically be inserted below the cursor.

ABOVE. A file comment will usually be inserted above the first line of a file
and therefore has 'above'.

APPEND. A documentation block to be put after a member needs 'append':

#--------------------------------------------------------------
==brief-after-member==append==
 /**< \brief|$CURSOR$|*/
#--------------------------------------------------------------

INSERT. In-text formulas should be put between a pair of |@f$| commands.  The
following template will be inserted in the running text. The cursor will be
set inside the construct.

#--------------------------------------------------------------
== Formula-in-text == insert ==
|@f$||$CURSOR$||@f$|
#--------------------------------------------------------------

All templates can have more than one line.


HINT. According to the syntax of the headline the 
'append' followed by '==' in the line

==brief-after-member==append==

is an insert mode specification. The 'append' in

==brief-after-member==append

is a comment. The insert mode is now 'below'.


==============================================================================
2.  THE DOXYGEN MENU                                     *doxygensupport-menu*
==============================================================================

The Doxygen menu will be generated when the editor starts (GUI only) or on
demand (see|doxygensupport-rebuild|).

The template names from the template definition file become menu items linked
with the template body. The template body will be inserted below the cursor.

The delimiter '.' has a special meaning: it separates a submenu name from its
submenu items. The template names

 ==block.short==
 ==block.long==
 ==block.special==

will generate a submenu entry 'block'  with the items 'short', 'long', and
'special' :

 block --+--> long
         |
         +--> short
         |
         +--> special

This feature can be used to arrange the templates into groups. The template
names 

 ==C.block-short==
 ==C.block-long==
 ==C.block-special==
 ==Cpp.block-short==
 ==Cpp.block-long==
 ==Cpp.block-special==

result in menus in which the templates are arranged according to C/C++
commenting styles:

 C   --+--> block-short
       +--> block-long
       +--> block-special
 Cpp --+--> block-short
       +--> block-long
       +--> block-special

The first group will be reached by Ex commands beginning with 'DoxyC' the
second group by 'DoxyCpp' (see below).

==============================================================================
3.  THE DOXYGEN EX COMMANDS                       *doxygensupport-ex-commands*
==============================================================================

This plugin generates an Ex command for each Doxygen template.  These commands
will be generated when the editor starts or on demand (see|doxygensupport-rebuild|).

Vim Ex command names have to start always with an uppercase letter followed by
letters or digits. Delimiters are not allowed.  The user defined template
names are therefore transformed into camel case notation.  The parts separated
by the delimiters are joined together now. The first letter of each part will
be transformed to uppercase. The new word will be prefixed by 'Doxy'. Some
examples:

 template name           Ex command
 ----------------------------------------
 ==block.long==          DoxyBlockLong
 ==block.short==         DoxyBlockShort
 ==block.special==       DoxyBlockSpecial
 ==file-header==         DoxyFileHeader
 ==function==            DoxyFunction

 ***  You do not need to remember the names of these Ex commands. Just type 
 ***  'Doxy' on the command line and use the tab expansion to show the names 
 ***  and to choose from.

NAMING CONFLICTS. The template names

 ==block-special==       DoxyBlockSpecial
 ==block+special==       DoxyBlockSpecial

will generate two different menu items but obviously the same Ex command name.
Avoiding these conflicts is up to you.

The Ex command leader can be changed (see|doxygensupport-customization|).

==============================================================================
4.  REBUILD MENUS AND EX COMMANDS                     *doxygensupport-rebuild*
==============================================================================

Rebuilding the menu(s) and the Ex commands is necessary after changing the
template file. 

GUI (gVim or Vim in an xterm)
----------------------------- 
If the template file is not open it can be opened from the first menu item
'Doxy (rebuild)'. Now edit the template file. Choosing the first menu item
again will save this buffer to the template file, reread it, and rebuild the
menu and the Ex commands. 
If the template file is already open choosing 'Doxygen' saves this buffer and
starts the rebuild immediately.

Console (Vim)
-------------
If the template file is not open it can be opened with the Ex command
'Doxygen'. This command is always defined. Now edit the template file.  Using
the command 'Doxygen' again will save this buffer to the template file, reread
it, and rebuild the Ex commands. 
If the template file is already open applying 'Doxygen' saves this buffer and
starts the rebuild immediately.

==============================================================================
5.  CUSTOMIZATION                               *doxygensupport-customization*
==============================================================================

Several global variables are checked by the script to customize it:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
global variable               default value              
----------------------------------------------------------------------
let g:Doxy_ExCommandLeader    'Doxy'
let g:Doxy_LoadMenus          'yes'
let g:Doxy_RootMenu           'Do&xy.'
let g:Doxy_TemplateFile       $HOME."/.vim/plugin/doxygen.templates"

The variable g:Doxy_ExCommandLeader can be used to change the default name of
the Ex command leader (see|doxygensupport-ex-commands|).  The string must
start with an uppercase letter and can contain only letters and digits.
Everything else will be removed.

The variable g:Doxy_LoadMenus controls if the Vim root menu item 'Doxy' will
appear after start. When set to 'no' the menu item can be made visible from
the 'tool' menu.

The variable g:Doxy_RootMenu, if set (in .vimrc or in .gvimrc), gives the name
of the single gVim root menu entry.  The default is 'Do&xy.' . Note the
terminating dot. An empty string is not allowed. The next character after & is
the shortcut key for this menu.

If you want to set the plugin menu into another menu, e.g. 'Plugin', this is
done by the following line in '.vimrc'

  let g:Doxy_RootMenu = "&Plugin.Do&xy."

The variable g:Doxy_TemplateFile can be used to change the name and the path
of the template file.
